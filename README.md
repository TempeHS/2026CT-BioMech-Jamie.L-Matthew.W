# Dextera

Our product is a prosthetic arm that is designed specifically for chess. This prosthetic will be tested by user David as he is a chess player 
that lost both his arms and is determined to continue playing chess as it is his passion. We intend to design a prosthetic arm that can allow 
David to pick and move pieces around easily and help him be able to freely play chess again.
