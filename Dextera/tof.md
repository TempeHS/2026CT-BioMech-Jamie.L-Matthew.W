I downloaded the library installation and copied the code from the examples into my tof.ino
This is not my final code as it is not mine, however i should use this as a baseline as it already provides the basics and an already working tof sensor
The baud rate must be changed as the code provided to me did not work with a 9600 baud rate. I also learnt that everything in the code must be the same or else it breaks


I used the seeed example code from copilot. I have not ttested it yet as i will not commit and push mid lesson.

I keep getting the same error saying that the startup measurement failed and i dont know how to fix it. I dont think its a hardware issue as ive tried switching multiple things around.

Still errors. Maybe its a hardware issue as my code works fine and im not getting any red errors.

I fixed the errors. I changed the buad rate from 9600 to 115200 and that solved the problem.

We keep getting a touch_setup was not declared in this scope but we think we have declared everything. Copilot is not helping

Still no progess on the error
