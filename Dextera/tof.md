I downloaded the library installation and copied the code from the examples into my tof.ino
This is not my final code as it is not mine, however i should use this as a baseline as it already provides the basics and an already working tof sensor
The baud rate must be changed as the code provided to me did not work with a 9600 baud rate. I also learnt that everything in the code must be the same or else it breaks


I used the seeed example code from copilot. I have not ttested it yet as i will not commit and push mid lesson.
